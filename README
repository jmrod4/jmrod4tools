===========

Well, I'm all for tools!

This project is a collection of **very simple** tools and tips for:

- Ruby
- Shell Scripts

At the moment I use them mostly as memory hooks, but they could eventually evolve into something more ambitious.

If you find something useful here **just let me know about it**. It could lead to future enhancements. Also if you want to contribute something or even forking the full project by all means do so.
