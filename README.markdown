jmrod4tools
===========

Well, I'm all for tools!

This project is a collection of **very simple** tools and tips for:

- Ruby
- Shell Scripts
- git

At the moment I use them myself mostly as memory hooks for myself. It's 
unlikely it could eventually evolve into something more ambitious but who 
knows.

If you find something useful here just you can let me know about it. 
It could lead to a morale boost. Also if you want to contribute something or 
even forking the full project then by all means do so.

Peace.
